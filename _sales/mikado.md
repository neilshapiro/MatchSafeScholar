The Mikado or, The Town of Titipu, operetta in two acts by W.S. Gilbert (libretto) and Sir Arthur Sullivan (music) that premiered at the Savoy Theatre in London on March 14, 1885.
When The Mikado was composed, Londoners had been enthusiastic about all things Japanese since the opening of Japan to the West in the mid-1850s. This match safe was made just after the opening of the Mikado.
Pictured on the safe are Yum-Yum and her sisters, Peep-Bo and Pitti-Sing (Trio: “Three Little Maids from School”)
