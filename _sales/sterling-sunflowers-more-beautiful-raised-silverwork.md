**Title:		Sterling Sunflowers & more Beautiful Raised Silver work**

 **
Material:	Sterling Silver**


**Maker:	       Battin & Co., Providence, RI 1896-1922**


**Condition:	Excellent**


**Notes:		Exceptional silver work, repoussé and applied. Four different flowers are shown on this safe, a lot of extra effort for the silver workers. Floriography is the term people use to describe Victorian flower language (if you need something to compare it to in the modern world, you can think of their use of flowers to be similar to the way we use emoji’s.) Ex. White Jasmin, shown on this safe means friendliness.**
