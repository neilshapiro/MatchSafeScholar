Louis Théophile Hingre, Basket of Vegetables and Snail, Match Safe, 19th century.


Very beautiful and rare match safe in bronze by Théophile Hingre, representing a basket of
vegetables on which a golden snail evolves. The lid simulates vegetables. Very good quality of
execution, bronze with double patina, very good condition. Signed under the base Hingre and
successor. Work from the end of the 19th century. Weight: 190 g. Dimensions: Height: 8 cm
(3.14”), Width: 5 cm (1.96”), Depth: 4 cm (1.57”)   Signed on bottom.

A three-dimensional sculptural match safe is very rare, especially one signed by a well-known
sculptor. The wicker work on the basket is articulated and accented with climbing vines.
Clinging to those vines is a patinated garden snail. The lid is an assemblage of vegetables with
the leaves of a root vegetable acting as a thumb lift.


The double patina is intact, that is, the body and lid on the match safe is a darker color and the
snail is a golden patina. The striker is a ribbed area on the back of the safe.


Hingre was undoubtedly influenced by Japonisme, the aesthetic movement that began in the
1870s and swept the Western world’s design ethos for the next 40 years. It also morphed into
two aesthetic movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Art Nouveau and Art Deco,
often erroneously thought to have been entirely creations of the West but impossible without
previous exposure to Japanese art and design. Echoes of Art Nouveau can be found in the
trailing vines on the basket and the asymmetry of the design.


Louis Théophile Hingre (also known as Théophile Hingre) was a French painter, sculptor,
engraver, illustrator, and poster artist. He was born in 1832 in Écouen, where he also died, in 1911. His specialty was sculptures of animals. Hingre, because of politics, moved to England. While in England, he worked in Birmingham as the ornamental sculptor of Elkington & Co. During this employment Hingre first began to sculpt
animals; his first works were horse racing trophies. Hingre exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1860,
despite his British exile. 1Hingre continued to work for Elkington & Co until he returned to France. There Hingre
regularly took part in the competitions of the 'Union centrale des arts décoratifs' and exhibited
almost yearly at the Paris Salon until he was 78. Hingre presented 45 works in the years 1860 to 1911.

He was also a member of many goldsmith’s organizations. Hingre won a gold medal at the
1878 International Workers Collective Exhibition and collaborated on works that obtained
medals at the 1878 and 1890 Universal Expositions.
