**Maker:        Gorham Mfg. Co., Providence, RI**


**Condition: Excellent**


**Notes:        An enamel and vermeil sterling 2” x 1 ½” x 3/8” match safe made by the Gorham Manufacturing Co., Providence, RI, in 1897, production #1308.**


**It is only one of four with this type of granulation ever made by Gorham. It is in excellent condition. (Gorham Match Safes, 2009, Shapiro, Neil)**


**Swirling raised lines have granules inter-spaced between the swirls. This technique of granulation is very old but difficult to do. It was revived as a decoration on jewelry after the excavations in the first half of the 19th century by the Italians.**


**The Gorham artisans added complexity to the work by carefully enameling the surfaces between the swirls and the granules. The green enamel is a subtle compliment to the vermeil (layer of gold is over a sterling body).**


**It is not gold plated.**
