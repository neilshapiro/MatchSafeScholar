**Description: 		Signed Japanese/Chinese** 


**Material:		Silver**


**Maker: 		        Unknown c. 1900**


**Measurements:	1 7/8” x 1 3/8”**


**Notes: 		The unusual thing about this safe is the two kinds of inscriptions, one in Japanese & one in Chinese. It was probably made in old China because the right line is in an old Chinese calendar system (4 letters indicate a period & a season.) The center line, also 4 letters is in a cursive that I could not get anyone to accurately translate. It may be a proverb. The left line indicates the name of the person who may have made the safe. While the name appears to a Chinese name the bottom 2 letters “seizou” is Japanese and means the product.**


**The interior of the lid also contains an inscription. (See images)**


**While a modest exterior the phoenix on a tree limb it is attractive, it is a very unique Asian/Japanese/Chinese piece.**
