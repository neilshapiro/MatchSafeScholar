Condition: Very good, some loss of nickel plating

The striker is at the base of Ally Sloper’s chin. Ally Sloper was created by C.H.
Ross in 1867. This safe is from a registered design of 1888 by F. Tomkinson. Made in
the UK.
This Ally Sloper safe, is in the image of the Victorian comic strip hero, with his battered
hat. Ally Sloper's *Half Holiday*, was the name of a weekly comic strip which first
appeared on 3 May 1884. From 1884 until the 1920s, the red-nosed social climber who
poked fun at the English people and their customs was a household name and national
favorite. This man became an institution and a national hero. Some people believed that he
existed; they even wrote to him and joined his club. There were medals presented in his
name. He represented the hopes and aspirations of a whole new class of people, brought
about the industrial revolution.
